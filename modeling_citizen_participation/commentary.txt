Kinda useless to pred # of issues.
What does it mean to have lotsa issues in a loc when there are 100+ types of issues?
In busy areas, it means there's lotsa parking enforcement.
And comparing that to the issues in a residential loc are like apples and oranges.

If we make a model to simply pred # of issues,
it will correl highly w high-traffic areas.

A more useful model wld break down the categs into groups,
prolly human-generated, but maybe also machine-generated,
and then make sep models, 
for eg, one for residential and one for business
and then the locs w both (like Back Bay?) will just not be represented well in the analysis.
